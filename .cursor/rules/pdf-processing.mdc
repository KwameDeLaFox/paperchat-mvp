# PDF Processing Guidelines

## File Validation
- Validate file type (PDF only)
- Check file size (max 10MB)
- Handle corrupted files gracefully
- Detect password-protected PDFs

## Text Extraction
- Use `pdf-parse` library for text extraction
- Handle extraction failures gracefully
- Provide clear error messages for failed extractions
- Show loading indicators during processing

## Text Chunking
- Split large documents into manageable chunks
- Respect OpenAI context window limits
- Keep chunks semantically meaningful
- Use smart chunking for better AI responses

## Error Messages
Use these specific error messages from the PRD:
- "File too large (max 10MB)"
- "Please upload a PDF file"
- "Unable to read this PDF. Try a different file."
- "This document is quite long. For best results, try asking specific questions."

## Processing Flow
1. File upload → validation
2. Text extraction → chunking
3. Store in memory (no persistence)
4. Ready for chat

## Memory Management
- Process files immediately
- Don't store files permanently
- Clear memory after processing
- Handle concurrent uploads gracefully
