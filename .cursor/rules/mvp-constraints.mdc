# MVP Constraints & Guidelines

## MVP Philosophy
Keep it simple, functional, and focused on core value proposition. Avoid feature creep.

## What's IN Scope (MVP Only)

### Core Features
- ✅ PDF upload with validation (max 10MB)
- ✅ Text extraction from PDFs
- ✅ Basic chat interface with OpenAI integration
- ✅ Sample PDF demo mode
- ✅ Feedback loop (thumbs up/down)
- ✅ Split layout (PDF viewer + chat)
- ✅ Error handling for common scenarios

### Technical Scope
- ✅ Next.js with pages router
- ✅ React functional components
- ✅ Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- ✅ In-memory storage (no database)
- ✅ OpenAI API integration
- ✅ Basic responsive design

## What's OUT of Scope (Post-MVP)

### Features to Avoid
- ❌ User accounts/authentication
- ❌ File storage/persistence
- ❌ Multiple document support
- ❌ Document search functionality
- ❌ Advanced PDF features (annotations, etc.)
- ❌ Complex analytics dashboard
- ❌ Real-time collaboration
- ❌ Mobile app versions

### Technical Complexity to Avoid
- ❌ Database setup and migrations
- ❌ Complex state management (Redux, Zustand)
- ❌ Server-side rendering optimization
- ❌ Advanced caching strategies
- ❌ Microservices architecture
- ❌ Complex deployment pipelines

## Development Guidelines

### Keep It Simple
- Use basic React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Avoid complex libraries unless absolutely necessary
- Prefer built-in browser APIs over third-party solutions
- Use simple in-memory storage instead of databases

### Focus on Core Value
- Every feature should directly support the core use case
- If a feature doesn't help users chat with PDFs, don't build it
- Prioritize functionality over polish
- Get the basic flow working before adding enhancements

### Error Handling
- Handle common errors gracefully
- Provide clear, user-friendly error messages
- Don't build complex error recovery systems
- Focus on preventing errors rather than complex handling

### Performance
- Don't optimize prematurely
- Focus on functionality first
- Use simple, proven solutions
- Avoid complex caching or optimization strategies

## Success Criteria
- User can upload a PDF and get a response within 2 minutes
- AI responses are relevant to the PDF content
- Basic error scenarios are handled gracefully
- Demo mode works for immediate testing
- Feedback system captures user sentiment

## Timeline Constraints
- Complete MVP in 5 days maximum
- Focus on P0 (critical) features first
- P1 features only if time permits
- P2+ features are explicitly out of scope
