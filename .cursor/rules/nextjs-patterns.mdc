# Next.js Development Patterns

## File Structure
- Use pages router (not app router) for simplicity
- API routes go in `/pages/api/`
- Components go in `/components/`
- Utilities go in `/utils/`

## Component Patterns
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components simple and focused
- Use Tailwind for styling (no custom CSS unless necessary)
- Export components as default exports

## State Management
- Use `useState` for local component state
- Use `useEffect` for side effects
- Keep state as close to where it's used as possible
- No complex state management libraries (Redux, Zustand, etc.)

## API Routes
- Use `/pages/api/` for backend functionality
- Handle errors gracefully with try/catch
- Return proper HTTP status codes
- Use environment variables for API keys

## Error Handling
- Always wrap API calls in try/catch
- Show user-friendly error messages
- Log errors for debugging
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

## Performance
- Keep bundle size minimal
- Use dynamic imports if needed
- Optimize images with Next.js Image component
- No premature optimization - focus on MVP functionality
